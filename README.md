idk I saw this tumblr post and it inspired me: https://www.tumblr.com/hatesuneenjoyer/723989284427792384/computers-feel-sexual-pleasure-every-time-you-plug?source=share

put simply its a basic operating system that uses the concept of reinforcement learning to create an agent that when interacted with via ports is rewarded in a way analagous to human sexual stimulation.
Why? its funny :p

Also I get to say I've made an OS and this is what I mean, which is so much funnier
